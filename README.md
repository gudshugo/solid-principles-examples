Implementation of SOLID principles in JAVA

SOLID principles were introduced by Robert J. Martin (Uncle Bob) in 2000. 

These five principles help us to understand the need of certain design patterns 
and software architecture in general. Adding these principles in your code can contribute
to avoiding code smells, refactoring code and so on. Design principles encourage us
to create more maintainable, understandable and flexible software.
